Today is the day of great news! One of the IntelAgir researchers together with German Professors had a project of new lab in Germany (`Zukunftslabore Antrag`) approved. 

The project called `Explainable Energy-Efficient and Safe Robotics (E3SR)` involves three different universities (2 German and UTFPR) and one research institute (ISW). It is going to be used for research on trading-off energy efficiency and safety in robotics. 

Prost!
