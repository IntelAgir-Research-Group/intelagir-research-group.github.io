We are happy to release our new website, which we expect to spread the word about our work, and help further collaborators to reach us. We are very active and motivated, despite the lack of investiments in research these days. Take a look and let us know! 


<!--
[ICSA](https://icsa-conferences.org/2021/) is the premier venue for practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, in component-based software engineering and in quality aspects of software and how these relate to the design of software architectures. ICSA has a strong tradition as a working conference, where researchers meet practitioners and software architects can explain the problems they face in their day-to-day work and try to influence the future of the field.
