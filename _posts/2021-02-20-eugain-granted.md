The project is called **Eugain**, which stands for "European Network For Gender Balance in Informatics".
The main aim of the Eugain COST Action is to improve *gender balance* in Informatics through the creation and strengthening of a truly multi-cultural European network of academics working at the forefront of the efforts in their countries, institutions, and research communities.

The role of Patricia in Eugain is as the Coordinator for Short-Term Scientific Missions (STSMs).
