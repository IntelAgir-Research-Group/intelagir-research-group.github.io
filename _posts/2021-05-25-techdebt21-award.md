A joint research of the S2Group was awarded with the best presentation award at the International Conference on Technical Debt [TechDebt21](https://2021.techdebtconf.org).

The research was co-authored by [Roberto Verdecchia](http://robertoverdecchia.github.io) and 
[Ilias Gerostathopoulos](https://iliasger.github.io) of the S2Group, and [Justus Bogner](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/Bogner) of the University of Stuttgart. 

The work, titled **Characterizing Technical Debt and Antipatterns in AI-Based Systems: A Systematic Mapping Study**, presents the first effort to characterize how technical debt and antipatterns manifest themselves in AI-centric systems.
The paper is available online at [this link](https://robertoverdecchia.github.io/papers/TechDebt_2021.pdf).
A short 15-minute presentation showcasing the obtained results is instead available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxoJ9iK4IekrbdFzxX-OgGttg_NQm4Uv/view?usp=sharing)

The recognition highlights the underlying S2Group vision of developing researches in the area of software sustainability, and communicating academic findings to a wider audience of researchers and practitioners.
