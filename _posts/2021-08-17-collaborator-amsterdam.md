All booked! After a while of researching in collaboration with [Ivano Malavolta](http://www.ivanomalavolta.com/) and [S2 Group](https://s2group.cs.vu.nl/), Michel Albonico is going to Amsterdam in mid-September for in-person work. He is quite excited about the opportunity to work with such great researchers. This must expand  Intel Agir horizons even wider.
