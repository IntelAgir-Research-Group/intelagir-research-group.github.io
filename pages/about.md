<!-- subtitle: X  -->
---

The IntelAgir Research Group is composed of a few professors and undergraduate students (we still do not have a Master/Doctorate program on the Campus). Our goal is to apply some intelligence and automation in multiple domain areas, including:

  - Smart Things in General (especially Smart City)
  - Robotics Software
  - Cloud-based Software
  - Natural Language Processing
  - Open Innovation
  - Gamification

We also focus on industrial-relevant projects, where some of the team members transit in the startup entrepreneurs' environment.

Finally, we maintain collaboration with researchers in Brazilian and international universities. If you want to collaborate, please send us an [e-mail](mailto://michelalbonico@utfpr.edu.br).

We carry out studies to support architectural software concepts in the area of Internet of Things (IoT), through data science we structure our research and apply scientific knowledge in the development of sustainable technologies. The Brazil has a society with critical elaboration capacity in face of the adoption of new technologies therefore, presenting a scientific basis, technical capacity and results are principles to develop and maintain software systems.

## Focus
Our **focus** is on the following scientific areas of interest:

  Our philosophy is that research should be industrial-relevant and serve the final purpose of being applied in practice. To this end, we specifically focus on the “real’’ needs of industrial practice by establishing collaboration with our industrial partners. In long term, the results of our research contribute to the European agenda by providing sustainable and innovative approaches to support service societies.

  We are proud members of [IPN (ICT Research Platform Nederland)](https://ict-research.nl){:target="_blank"}, the platform that unites all Dutch academic research groups that have ICT science as their core; and [VERSEN](http://www.versen.nl){:target="_blank"} (the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering). We are affiliated with the [SIKS research school](http://www.siks.nl){:target="_blank"}.
